Reflection

Manual NFT trading requires trust between participants. Since transfers are not atomic, one party may transfer their NFT while the other does not complete the swap. There is no escrow protection or atomic guarantee, creating risk. A vault-based escrow smart contract or atomic swap program could solve this by ensuring both NFTs are exchanged in a single transaction, improving security and trustlessness.
